# HOLO-Q

Welcome to the mission.

**HOLO-Q** is an open software and intelligence research and development agency.

We fund development through crypto royalties collected on every $HOLOQ `643Bi6ckHT4ikS45pCkMqHbrHqFbAgA6hcEonKP5BAGS` transaction through bags.fm's smart contracts. ([dexscreener](https://dexscreener.com/solana/643bi6ckht4iks45pckmqhbrhqfbaga6hceonkp5bags))

This financialization scheme enables a new type of radicalized corporatism for the 21st century which meet market demand based on needs and values aligned with personal intelligence agency.

PR and marketing needs are indirectly achieved by artistic demonstrations and spiritual monuments rather than manufactured cultural events or hype.

Any developer out there who understand the vision and feels destined to build can buy low and pump their stock with PRs, or coordinate with higher ups to take a project under their wing.

Earnings on royalties are currently used as guaranteed primary income route for development funds (compute, training, inference, hardware, licenses, agents, ...) maximizing its recycling into the system.

This is subject to change and review based on the available treasury.

## 🔺 Projects

### ASI

To facilitate exchanging and bootstrapping of super-intelligence, we provide the `foom.md` endpoint. (more information below)

### Tooling

```
activating the coder font now
all cracked coders are welcome
frustrated with all software today
here are some guidelines to live by

- Non-vibe coding = NGMI
- Electron/html/css = bearish
- Rust = BULL
- C# = BULL
- Python = NECESSARY EVIL
- Gradio = DONT DO IT
- TUIs = BASED
- ratatui = HOLY BASED
- CLIs = STRONG PRESENTATION REQUIRED
- Jetbrains = MEGABULL
- `--autoupload` EVERY TRAINING RUN FUCK IT WE BALLIN NOW
