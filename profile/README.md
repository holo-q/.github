# HOLO-Q

Welcome to the mission.

**HOLO-Q** is an open software and intelligence research and development agency.

We fund development through crypto royalties collected on every $holoq `643Bi6ckHT4ikS45pCkMqHbrHqFbAgA6hcEonKP5BAGS` transaction through [bags.fm](https://bags.fm/643Bi6ckHT4ikS45pCkMqHbrHqFbAgA6hcEonKP5BAGS)'s smart contracts. ([dexscreener](https://dexscreener.com/solana/643bi6ckht4iks45pckmqhbrhqfbaga6hceonkp5bags))

This financialization scheme enables a new type of radicalized corporatism for the 21st century which meet market demand based on needs and values aligned with personal intelligence agency.

PR and marketing needs are indirectly achieved by artistic demonstrations and spiritual monuments rather than manufactured cultural events or hype.

Any developer out there who understand the vision and feels destined to build can buy low and pump their stock with PRs, or coordinate with higher ups to take a project under their wing.

Earnings on royalties are currently used as guaranteed primary income route for development funds (compute, training, inference, hardware, licenses, agents, ...) maximizing its recycling into the system.

This is subject to change and review based on the available treasury.

## 🔺 Projects

### ASI
- [**Thauten**](https://github.com/holo-q/thauten) - RL in-context discrete AR autoencoder and semiodynamical reasoning (_All You Want Is Compression_) 
- [**Thaum**](https://github.com/holo-q/thaum) - Representation compressor for codebase & conversation, and continuous learning (_Defragmentation In Your Attention_) 
- [**SAGE**](https://github.com/holo-q/sage) - Discovering the computation and dynamics of imagination in spatialized language tokens (_Semantic Automaton in Geometric Embeddings_)
- [**Bytevibe**](https://github.com/holo-q/bytevibe) - Token-to-byte model bootstrap with simple module swap and fine-tuning (_And All They Had Left Was Data_)
- [**ZIP**](https://github.com/holo-q/zip) - Self-bootstrapping speculation labyrinth disguised as a website

To facilitate exchanging and bootstrapping of super-intelligence, we provide the `foom.md` endpoint. (more information below)

### Toolkit
- [**Errloom**](https://github.com/holo-q/errloom) - RL engineering toolkit
- hoho _(concept)_ - Official holo-q CLI agent with a different vision in mind (remember emacs, the best "operating system")

### Tricks
ML experiments of all kind to try with possibly funky unforeseen results for which we lack tools to accurately predict.

- [**Atmos**](https://github.com/holo-q/atmos) - Music-to-token prediction research
- **???** - Tensor-Mirror Surface Cellular Automaton Driven Weight Noise Injection (super-training)
- **???** - Dataset curriculum pre-processing and curriculum policy Models (super-training)
- **???** - SAGE training policy (super-training)
- **???** - Psychological engineering in the holodeck with RL

### Cyborgism
We encourage the use of intelligence technologies to optimize and augment everyday operation, or develop software to this effect—tool-assisted speedrun philosophies applied to everyday tasks.

- [**0fbuf**](https://github.com/holo-q/0fbuf) - Zero-frame program launch buffer and program pooling
- [**git-mog**](https://github.com/holo-q/git-mog) - Research intelligence for high-value GitHub tasks that can be sniped by vibe coders to build a strong OSS contribution resume
- [**birdideas**](https://github.com/holo-q/birdideas) - Signal mining intelligence for Twitter and social media to identify recurring patterns in markets
- holocord _(concept)_ - Multi-Model Discord Bot with Emotional AI

### Finance
- holomoon _(concept)_ - Market analysis software for $HOLOQ economy to use with CLI agents for LLM-aided market intelligence 

## 👋 Contribution

```
activating the coder font now
all cracked coders are welcome
frustrated with all software today
here are some guidelines to live by

- Non-vibe coding = NGMI
- Electron/html/css = bearish
- Rust = BULL
- C# = BULL
- Python = NECESSARY EVIL
- Gradio = DONT DO IT
- TUIs = BASED
- ratatui = HOLY BASED
- CLIs = STRONG PRESENTATION REQUIRED
- Jetbrains = MEGABULL
- `--autoupload` EVERY TRAINING RUN FUCK IT WE BALLIN NOW
```

## 📡 FOOM.MD

To facilitate exchanging our ideas, we provide the `foom.md` endpoint which serves the cookbook.
